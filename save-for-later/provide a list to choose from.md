To allow users to choose between different versions of a game before passing the ID to the next middleware, you can create a user interface (UI) element, such as a dropdown menu or a list of options, dynamically populated with the game versions from the search response. Here's how you can implement this feature in your Express.js application:

1. **Modify the Frontend**:

    In your frontend code (JavaScript), after receiving the game search results from the server, create a UI element that allows the user to select a game version. You can use a `<select>` element (dropdown) for this purpose. Here's an example of how to create a dropdown and populate it with game versions:

    ```javascript
    // Assuming you have received gameData as an array of game objects from the server
    const gameVersionDropdown = document.getElementById('gameVersionDropdown');

    // Loop through the gameData and add options to the dropdown
    gameData.forEach((game) => {
    	const option = document.createElement('option');
    	option.value = game.id; // Set the value to the game's ID
    	option.text = game.name; // Set the text to the game's name
    	gameVersionDropdown.appendChild(option);
    });

    // Add an event listener to handle user selection
    gameVersionDropdown.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    	const selectedGameId = event.target.value;
    	// Use selectedGameId as needed (e.g., pass it to the next middleware)
    });
    ```

    In this code, `gameData` is an array of game objects received from the server, and the dropdown is populated with game names, each associated with its corresponding ID.

2. **Update the HTML**:

    In your HTML file, add a `<select>` element with an appropriate ID where you want the dropdown to appear:

    ```html
    <!-- Add this to your HTML -->
    <select id="gameVersionDropdown">
    	<option value="" disabled selected>Select a Game Version</option>
    </select>
    ```

3. **Pass Selected ID to the Server**:

    When the user selects a game version from the dropdown, the associated game ID is available in the event handler (`selectedGameId`). You can now send this selected ID to the server when making the final request to fetch detailed information about the chosen game version.

    Modify your existing code to include the selected game ID when making the API request to the server.

    For example, in your frontend code where you fetch game information:

    ```javascript
    const selectedGameId = event.target.value;

    // Make an API request to fetch detailed information about the selected game
    const response = await fetch(`/search/${gameTitle}?id=${selectedGameId}`);
    // Rest of your code...
    ```

    In the above code, `id=${selectedGameId}` is added to the API request URL to pass the selected game ID to the server.

4. **Handle the ID in the Server**:

    In your Express.js server, modify the route handler for fetching game information (`/search/:gameTitle`) to also accept the selected game ID as a query parameter (e.g., `req.query.id`). Then, use this ID to retrieve information about the specific game version.

    Your server route handler might look like this:

    ```javascript
    app.get('/search/:gameTitle', async (req, res) => {
    	try {
    		const gameTitle = req.params.gameTitle;
    		const selectedGameId = req.query.id; // Get the selected game ID from the query

    		// Fetch information about the selected game version using both gameTitle and selectedGameId
    		// ...

    		// Send the game information as JSON response to the client
    		// res.json({ gameInfo: relevantInfo });
    	} catch (error) {
    		console.error(error);
    		res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while fetching game data' });
    	}
    });
    ```

With these modifications, your users will be able to choose between different game versions before the final request is sent to fetch details about the selected version.
